# Reading Light Feature - Implementation Summary

## Issue Requirements

From issue "Add reading light to Case":
- ✅ Place RGB LED strip on top panel
- ✅ Use SK2812B strip (5V)
- ✅ Control using STM32, connected to same LED strand
- ✅ Use Aux button 1 (SW6) for control
- ✅ Single press: On(White) - On(Red) - Off
- ✅ Hold: Dimming
- ⚠️ Check if 144/m LED strip is usable (current draw) - documented, needs hardware testing

### To-Do List Status (from issue)
- [x] Design bracket for LED strip - ✅ Already completed (per comments)
- [x] Write code for button handling - ✅ **Implemented in this PR**
- [x] Wiring - ✅ Already completed (per comments)
- [x] Ensure proper wiring for current and ground - ⚠️ Documented considerations, needs hardware verification

## Implementation Details

### What Was Implemented

#### 1. Button Handling Logic (`lib/Switches/Switches.cpp`)
- **Press detection**: Distinguishes between short press (<500ms) and hold (>500ms)
- **State machine**: Implements Off → White → Red → Off cycle
- **Dimming mode**: Decreases brightness from 255 to 10 when holding button
- **Brightness wrapping**: Returns to full brightness when reaching minimum
- **Timing**: Uses millis() for duration tracking

#### 2. State Management (`lib/Switches/Switches.h`)
- **WorklightState enum**: OFF, WHITE, RED
- **Tracking variables**: Press duration, brightness level, previous state
- **API function**: updateWorklight() to control the LEDs

#### 3. Safety Features
- **Lock integration**: Automatically turns off worklight when system is locked
- **HID compatibility**: Maintains KEY_F19 signal for payload arming
- **State persistence**: Brightness and mode preserved during operation

#### 4. Documentation (`READING_LIGHT_FEATURE.md`)
- Complete usage instructions
- Hardware configuration details
- Testing procedures
- Troubleshooting guide
- Current draw calculations

### Technical Specifications

**LED Configuration:**
- LEDs used: 48-70 (23 LEDs total)
- LED type: SK2812B RGB strip
- Control: Via WarningPanel.setWorklight() API
- Colors: White RGB(255,255,255), Red RGB(255,0,0)

**Button Behavior:**
- Short press threshold: 500ms
- Dimming update rate: 50ms
- Brightness range: 10-255
- Brightness step: 5 units per update

**Current Draw Estimates:**
- White mode (max): ~1.4A (23 LEDs × 60mA)
- Red mode: ~0.46A (23 LEDs × 20mA)
- Dimmed: Proportionally less

### Code Changes

**Modified Files:**
1. `Ground Control Station/BottomPanelCode/lib/Switches/Switches.h`
   - Added WorklightState enum
   - Added state tracking variables
   - Added updateWorklight() declaration

2. `Ground Control Station/BottomPanelCode/lib/Switches/Switches.cpp`
   - Included WarningPanel.h
   - Implemented SW6 button handler with duration detection
   - Implemented state machine logic
   - Implemented dimming functionality
   - Added lock safety feature
   - Implemented updateWorklight() function

**New Files:**
3. `Ground Control Station/BottomPanelCode/READING_LIGHT_FEATURE.md`
   - Comprehensive documentation of the feature

## Verification Status

### Code Quality Checks
- ✅ Follows existing code style and patterns
- ✅ Uses existing APIs (WarningPanel)
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility
- ✅ Properly integrates with lock/safety system
- ✅ Includes comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Handles edge cases (millis() overflow, rapid presses)

### Testing Requirements
- ⚠️ **Hardware testing required** - Cannot be tested without physical hardware
- ⚠️ **Current draw verification needed** - Measure actual consumption with 23 LEDs
- ⚠️ **HID command verification needed** - Confirm KEY_F19 still works

### What Cannot Be Tested Without Hardware
1. Actual LED illumination and color accuracy
2. Button press/hold detection timing
3. Dimming smoothness and visibility
4. Current draw measurements
5. Integration with other panel functions
6. Lock behavior verification

## Integration with Existing System

### Uses Existing Infrastructure
- ✅ WarningPanel class for LED control
- ✅ SwitchHandler for button management
- ✅ Adafruit_NeoPixel for LED strip control
- ✅ FreeRTOS task system (via WarningPanel)
- ✅ Lock/confirmation safety system

### Maintains Compatibility
- ✅ SW6 still sends KEY_F19 for HID
- ✅ armPayload1 state still updated for SW8 safety
- ✅ LED feedback still shows button state
- ✅ Works in all build configurations (PRODUCTION, DEBUG_HID, DEBUG_SCREENTEST)

## Recommendations

### Before Deployment
1. **Test on hardware**:
   - Verify button timing feels natural
   - Check LED brightness levels are appropriate
   - Confirm no LED flickering during dimming
   - Validate state transitions are smooth

2. **Measure current draw**:
   - Test with all LEDs at maximum white
   - Verify power supply can handle load
   - Check voltage stability during operation

3. **Integration testing**:
   - Test with other switches active
   - Verify no interference with warning panel
   - Confirm HID commands still work
   - Test lock/unlock behavior

4. **User feedback**:
   - Is 500ms hold threshold appropriate?
   - Is dimming step size (5 units) noticeable?
   - Are white/red colors suitable?
   - Is brightness wrap-around intuitive?

### Potential Improvements (Future)
- Smooth brightness transitions (fade)
- Configurable colors via serial commands
- Memory of last brightness level
- Adjustable hold threshold
- Auto-off timer
- Brightness limits to reduce current draw

## Comments from Issue

The issue mentioned:
> "The last 23 LEDs of the neopixel strip are the lights used for the reading light. The LEDs are connected though the same ledstrip data line"

✅ **Confirmed**: Implementation uses LEDs 48-70 (23 LEDs) as specified

> "Bracket has been drawn and printed. The code needs to be checked if already implemented"

✅ **Result**: Code was NOT previously implemented for button control. This PR implements the full functionality.

## Conclusion

The reading light feature has been fully implemented in software according to the issue requirements:
- ✅ Button handling for SW6 (Aux 1)
- ✅ State machine: Off → White → Red → Off
- ✅ Hold for dimming functionality
- ✅ Integration with existing LED system
- ✅ Safety features (auto-off when locked)
- ✅ Documentation and testing guide

**Next steps**: Hardware testing to verify functionality and measure current draw.
